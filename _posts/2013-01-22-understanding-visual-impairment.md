According to the [National Federation of the Blind] (https://nfb.org/blindness-statistics), 6,670,300 adults in the  United States have a visual disability. A visual impairment or disability limits the visual capability of an individual to such a degree that they require assistance to complete everyday tasks. Visual impairments are often the result of trauma, disease, congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by medication, surgery or refractive correction. 90% of the world's visually impaired live in developing countries and 80% of all visual impairment can be avoided or cured by conventional means.

There are 3 levels of visual impairment:

* Moderate visual impairment
* Severe visual impairment
* Blindness

## Who Is At Risk?

65% of people with visual impairments are over 50 years and with an ever increasing elderly population in many countries, more people will be at risk of age-related visual impairment. An estimated 19,000,000 children under 15 years are visually impaired with 12,000,000 due to refractive errors that have not yet been diagnosed or corrected, while 1,400,000 are irreversibly blind.

## The Causes?

Disorders of the eye that lead to visual impairments can include [retinal degeneration](http://www.ffb.ca/eye_conditions/RD_diseases.html), [albinism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism), [cataracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract), [glaucoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma), muscular problems, [corneal disorders](http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/cornealdisease/), [diabetic retinopathy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy), [congenital disorders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder), infection and [cortical disorders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_visual_impairment).

Refractive errors ([myopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia), [hyperopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperopia) or [astigmatism](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158810.php)) are naturally occuring, with 43% of people with visual imparments are born with refractive errors that can be corrected with medication, surgery, glasses or contact lenses.

## The Challenges?

Before the industrial revolution, people with visual impairments were often institutionalized, and denied educational and vocational opportunities. Starting in 1973 with the passage of Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, and in 1990 with the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, people with visual disabilities were legally guaranteed rights that improved their educational opportunities, their ability to access public spaces, and an industry that produced functional assistive technology. All of these advances have allowed people with visual disabilities to live full and independent lives.

There are still challenges for people with visual disabilities, especially using technology, and browsing the internet. For example, many websites are challenging to navigate using a screen reader, which makes the content nearly impossible for someone with a visual impairment to access. The a11y project is working to make more websites more easily accessible to people with visual disabilities. 

## The Future's Bright

Louis Braille invented the Braille system for reading and writing in 1824, giving access to previously inaccessible literature. Helen Keller overcame the institutionalized education system of the 19th century, becoming the first deaf/blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts Degree. In 1980, Bob Stepp developed the first Braille editing program, and in the modern era of internet we hold the key to accessibility for this generation and many more to come.
